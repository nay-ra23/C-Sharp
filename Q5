Question-5
Problem Statement  – In a theater, there is a discount scheme announced where one gets a 10% discount on the total cost of tickets when there is a bulk booking of more than 20 tickets, and a discount of 2% on the total cost of tickets if a special coupon card is submitted. Develop a program to find the total cost as per the scheme. The cost of the k class ticket is Rs.75 and q class is Rs.150. Refreshments can also be opted by paying an additional of Rs. 50 per member.

Hint: k and q and You have to book minimum of 5 tickets and maximum of 40 at a time. If fails display “Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets”.  If circle is given a value other than ‘k’ or ‘q’ the output should be “Invalid Input”.

The ticket cost should be printed exactly to two decimal places.

Sample Input 1:

Enter the no of ticket:35
Do you want refreshment:y
Do you have coupon code:y
Enter the circle:k
Sample Output 1:

Ticket cost:4065.25
Sample Input 2:

Enter the no of ticket:1
Sample Output 2:

Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets
